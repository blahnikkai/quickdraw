- UX prettification
- Increasing difficulty
- Map sockets to gid for easy leave on disconnect instead of looping through all games/rooms
- Make player info not shift up on status
- Add animations/transition to names on join
- Make player info a grid?
- Pass functions to components instead of socket and gid
- Change colors

- Should used set persist between rounds?
    - If it does, it's possible to be invalid and used, display invalid first
- Don't display user info to self
- Display guess status icons to player and to other players in player info. 
    - Only for short time, use timeout
- Only allow unique nicknames?
- Wrong guess leads to shorter timer?
