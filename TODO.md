High
- Change colors
- Show names even when not ready
- Don't display user info to self? I wrote this a while ago tbh, not sure what it means, just display separately probably
- New font
- Don't disable input, then you lose focus each time

Medium
- UX prettification
- Increasing difficulty
- Wrong guess leads to shorter timer?
- Display guess status icons to player and to other players in player info. 
    - Only for short time, use timeout

Low
- Map sockets to gid for easy leave on disconnect instead of looping through all games/rooms
- Only allow unique nicknames?

Unsorted
- Make player info not shift up on status
- Add animations/transition to names on join
- Make player info a grid?
- Pass functions to components instead of socket and gid
- Move .nickname style to Nickname folder
- Change passing Socket to socketId in backend

- Should used set persist between rounds?
    - If it does, it's possible to be invalid and used, display invalid first
